# Bicep Project Improvement Plan

This document tracks necessary improvements to the Azure Bicep templates and deployment process.

## Immediate Priorities

1. **Fix DNS Resolution Issues**
   -  Correct the privatelink.azurewebsites.net DNS resolution
   -  Fix incorrect CNAME chain pointing to SQL server
   -  Ensure SCM site DNS resolution for deployment access

2. **Verify Application Deployment**
   -  Monitor database import progress (deployment script db-import-1740895944)
   -  Test web application through Front Door URL
   -  Verify connectivity between app and database

3. **Automate Deployment Process**
   -  Enhance deploy-app.sh script to handle all scenarios
   -  Finalize VM-based deployment approach for private endpoint access
   -  Test end-to-end deployment with new automation

## Architecture & Security Improvements

4. **Firewall Rule Refinement**
   -  Fix open DNAT rule for SSH with source '*' (currently too permissive)
   -  Organize rules into proper collection categories
   -  Document rule purposes and requirements
   -  Replace hardcoded IP addresses with parameters

5. **VPN Configuration**
   -  Complete VPN implementation in vpn.bicep
   -  Fix p2sVpnGateway reference issues
   -  Implement proper authentication methods
   -  Set up client certificate generation process

6. **Security Hardening**
   -  Implement Key Vault network restrictions
   -  Configure SQL Server with transparent data encryption
   -  Set minimum TLS version for all resources
   -  Add RBAC-based access control
   -  Improve credential handling with Key Vault integration

## Code Quality & Best Practices

7. **Standardize Naming Conventions**
   -  Establish consistent resource prefixes
   -  Align camelCase/kebab-case usage across all templates
   -  Standardize parameter naming patterns

8. **Improve Error Handling**
   -  Enhance deployment scripts with better error recovery
   -  Implement conditional deployment logic
   -  Add proper dependency management
   -  Create clear strategies for resource recreation

9. **Optimize Resources**
   -  Implement lifecycle management for storage
   -  Configure auto-scaling for App Service
   -  Set up key rotation and secret expiration
   -  Optimize Front Door with caching and CDN settings

## Documentation & Testing

10. **Create Comprehensive Documentation**
    -  Develop README.md with architecture overview
    -  Document deployment process and prerequisites
    -  Create troubleshooting guide for common issues
    -  Add architecture diagrams for visual clarity

11. **Deployment Testing**
    -  Create validation scripts for pre-deployment checks
    -  Develop rollback strategies for failed deployments
    -  Implement resource locking for critical components
    -  Add health checks for deployed resources

12. **CI/CD Integration**
    -  Design pipeline for handling private endpoint deployments
    -  Create templates for automated deployments
    -  Implement secrets management for CI/CD
    -  Set up monitoring and alerting in deployment pipeline

## Detailed Code Review Findings

### Naming Conventions
- Inconsistent camelCase/kebab-case usage
- Resource prefix inconsistencies
- Parameter naming patterns vary

### Security Best Practices
- Key Vault missing network access restrictions
- Storage Account security needs enhancement
- SQL Server missing transparent data encryption
- Firewall has overly permissive rules
- NSG configuration needs improvement

### Error Handling and Idempotency
- Script-based deployment dependencies need better error handling
- Missing handling for resource recreation scenarios
- Inconsistent dependency management
- Limited conditional deployment logic

### Resource Optimization
- Storage Account optimization needed
- App Service configuration not integrated with Key Vault
- Key Vault configuration missing key rotation
- Front Door missing caching optimization

### Documentation
- Inconsistent parameter descriptions
- Module purpose documentation limited
- Configuration options not fully documented
- Missing architecture diagrams

### Deployment Workflow
- Some steps require manual intervention
- Limited validation in deployment process
- Resource locking not implemented
- Deployment sequencing issues

### VPN Configuration
- Implementation incomplete
- Missing client configuration
- Limited validation

### Front Door and DNS
- Configuration relies on scripts instead of Bicep resources
- DNS configuration overly complex
- Private link approval automation needs improvement

### Firewall Rules
- Organization needs improvement
- Hardcoded IP addresses
- Missing application rules
- Limited logging and monitoring
